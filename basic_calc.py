"""
This example illustrates Python expressions -
a type of statement that returns a value.

Statements
----------

Some statements perform an action, like printing a value to the screen.

Some statements are expressions, which return a value.

Expressions
-----------

Data analytics is all about getting value out of data.
Expressions are the building blocks of data analytics.

Rather like math expressions, Python expressions
are a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls.

Expressions are made of operands and operators.

- Operators are symbols like +, -, *, /, and =.
- Operands can be values or variables, 
  and can include function calls like len() and str().

Writing expressions in Python is like writing formulas in Excel.
